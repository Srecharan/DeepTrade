### Training Process
The model training pipeline includes:

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - 15 technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
  - 12 long-term trend indicators
  - 12 sentiment-based features

- **Training Strategy**:
  - Time-series cross-validation
  - Dynamic learning rate scheduling
  - Early stopping with patience
  - Model performance tracking

- **Model Performance Metrics**:
  - LSTM Mean: 0.3630, Std: 0.1007
  - XGBoost Mean: 0.1408, Std: 0.0622
  - Average Training Length: 60-120 epochs
  - Convergence monitored through validation loss
  - Early stopping with 30-epoch patience
  - Cross-validation with 5 folds

The metrics represent Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on normalized returns. Model training uses a sliding window approach with dynamic batch sizes and learning rate adjustment based on validation performance.

```

### Live Trading Architecture
The system employs a sophisticated paper trading implementation through Tradier's sandbox API, enabling real-time market simulation with a focus on intraday trading:

```python
# Core Configuration
initial_capital = 100000.0
timeframe = '15min'
symbols = ['NVDA', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GME', 'AMD', 'JNJ', 'META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN']
```

### Risk Management Framework
```python
# Risk Controls
max_positions = 2              # Maximum concurrent positions
position_size = 0.02          # 2% capital per trade
max_daily_risk = 0.02        # Maximum 2% account risk per day
max_trade_risk = 0.01        # Maximum 1% risk per trade
stop_loss_pct = 0.015        # 1.5% stop loss
take_profit_pct = 0.03       # 3% take profit
```

### Strategy Implementation
```python
# Signal Generation Pipeline
# 1. Price Analysis
trend_composite = (
    daily_trend_score * 0.4 +     # Daily trend (strong_uptrend: 2, uptrend: 1, sideways: 0, etc.)
    hourly_trend_score * 0.4 +    # Hourly trend
    minute_trend_score * 0.2      # 15-min trend
)

# 2. Entry Signal Generation
entry_conditions = {
    'trend_composite': trend_composite > 0,
    'volume_condition': (
        market_analysis['15min']['relative_volume'] > 0.8 or
        market_analysis['1h']['relative_volume'] > 0.5 or
        market_analysis['1d']['relative_volume'] > 0.3
    ),
    'near_support': min(support_distances) <= 0.02,
    'near_resistance': min(resistance_distances) <= 0.02
}

# 3. Position Management
position_params = {
    'max_hold_time': 180,    # Maximum minutes
    'min_hold_time': 5,      # Minimum minutes
    'stop_loss_pct': 0.015,  # 1.5% stop loss
    'take_profit_pct': 0.03  # 3% take profit
}
```

### Trading Controls
- Maximum 2 concurrent positions
- Position hold time: 5-180 minutes
- Volume requirements:
  * 15-min volume > 80% average
  * Hourly volume > 50% average
  * Daily volume > 30% average
- Multi-timeframe trend analysis:
  * Daily trend weight: 40%
  * Hourly trend weight: 40%
  * 15-min trend weight: 20%
- Entry types:
  * Pullback: Near support with trend > -0.5
  * Breakout: Near resistance with trend > -0.3
  * Momentum: Trend composite > 0.3
